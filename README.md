# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**.  
The goal is to solve one puzzle each day!


## 🧰 Setup

I use Python and a local virtual environment.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>
```

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
```

## 📁 Structure

The solutions are organized in separate folders for each day:

```text
.
├─ day01/
│  ├─ input.txt
│  ├─ toy-input.txt
│  └─ solution.py
├─ day02/
│  ├─ input.txt
│  ├─ toy-input.txt
│  └─ solution.py
...
├─ venv/        # virtuelle Umgebung (nicht committed)
└─ README.md
```

Each day has:

- input.txt (from Advent of Code)
- toy-input.txt (as example input for testing)
- solution.py (my solution)

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

To run the solution for a specific day, execute the Python script:

```bash
python day01/solution.py   # For Day 1
```
